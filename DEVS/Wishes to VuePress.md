# Wishes to VuePress

## Error messages

- No proper error messages if something's wrong with the input (just blank page in browser; no console errors)

Note: This may vary by the errors. The one that caused problems was a `<p>` at the end of the original markdowns. Quite annoying not being told, what's wrong.

## `.vuepress` at project root

Don't understand why not. 

VuePress configuration is not part of my docs. Why must it be at `docs/.vuepress/config.js` and not `.vuepress/config.js`???
