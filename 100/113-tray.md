# 113 - Front tray

>![](.images/113-tray.png)

Just a simple tray. Needs to fit within its place and support:

- electronics
- batteries
- possible pneumatics actuators (MVP 0.2)

## Design notes

The suggested design can be made from sheet metal, but even a net of some kind would work (electronics hammock, yeee!). üèï

In addition to the pictured design, the bottom can have some holes for fixing the parts. All of this can be done ad hoc, once ballast is better known.

## Concerns

The pictured square design overlaps slightly with the current central hub (`#112-000`). There needs to be a circular cutting towards the hub.

*Add concerns here*

## Specs

Length and width are dictated by the surrounding parts (positioning of wheels and the central hub).
