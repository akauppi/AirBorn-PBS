# 160 - Batteries

Provide power for (MVP 0.1):

- wheel motors
- central hub motor
- control unit


GEM Motors G1.1 states:

- 24-75 V (likely better performance with more voltage?
- 1,5kW nominal, 3kW peak power

Likely we'll end up with something like 48V batteries - something commonly available and used in electric bicycles could serve well.


## Open issues

- [ ]Â Which batteries would suit running two GEM Motors G1.1's, at reasonable speed? (note: for MVP 0.2 we'll need to run four, when switching lanes)


## Requirement to other parts
