## Track captive

Monorail vehicles are often designed to be captive to the track, meaning they cannot fall off it, no matter what. 

This is less of a problem in traditional monorails, where the rail itself can be rather massive.

With a slender track and light vehicles, the chances of capsizing a vehicle by eg. crashing of one of the support poles becomes a viability. For this kind of "from the below" accidents, vehicles in Ultra Light Rail systems should be made track captive, binding survivability of the passengers to that of the track itself.

The Kotka design provides track captivity via the claw design (not allowing the cabin to fall "inwards") and another design (not yet in the docs), keeping the vehicle from falling "outwards". The latter is needed only for cases where the track itself is compromised (eg. tilted, as a result of a road level accident). In normal operation, the center of mass of the vehicle is safely on the "inside" side of the main rail, thus keeping it from capsizing outwards.
