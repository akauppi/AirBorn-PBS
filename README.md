# AirBorn - a vehicle platform

Making of a 21st century vehicle platform

- capable of transporting 2,5 people (240kg)
- running on a rail, in the air
- speeds ~40..70 km/h
- buildable by readily available or easily manufacturable parts
- easily fixable
- "transparent" to the nature

This mode of transport is called "PRT" or Personal Rail Transit, by some. It could be an electric solution for what traffic planners call "feeder systems" - ways for people to reach the metro/rail/subway station.

If cheap, reliable and comfortable to ride, such an offering could transform 2020's transportation planning. Maybe even city planning, since instead of building high-rises near the stations, the reach of PRT would allow people to live further apart from the station (in distance), yet equally close in time.

*Figure 1. Less this; more that.*

Since the tracks are above the ground ("off grade" in transport planner parlance), the tracks don't cause hindrance to other transport in the way that roads or trams do. You can walk, bicycle or drive below them.



## Who should build it?

PRT's have been around. It's never "flown" commercially so either it's not possible, or the models used earlier have been missing something. The deal is to get this into transport planning *mainstream* - to make it a hard-to-pass reality that customers (cities) ask of the planners. That, again, needs citizens to be aware so they know about the possibility. üòä

The model taken here is to JUST HACK IT!!

Aim for this stage is to make a working proof of concept that shows the potential. Making it out in the open so that people with various skills (CAD, electronics, mechanics, pneumatics, embedded software, cloud software, PR, video production) can contribute.

Making it FUN. For the makers. For the backers. For the general audience.

Let's ROLL! 



## CAD Model

üçå

Asko (the founder) made an initial model in 2019, but something went wrong. It's not supposed to look like this:<sub>[Fusion 360 project](https://a360.co/2sn1Wej)</sub>

>![](.images/not-supposed-to-look-so.png)

Learning from the mistakes, a new start was made in 2020.

This time, the models are spread over multiple Fusion 360 projects. Having everything in a single "file" turned out to be making things harder and harder to fix (and easier and easier to break).

That's better.

>Note: This image lacks crucial elements like the grabber arms and is outdated. But it shows a minimum set of components that can be designed, assembled, tested and iterated upon.

## Product Breakdown System (PBS)

There is a [PBS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G5YIdf7PlUv7BphEBALlFeB5Ye0DMoW4dylRe6NaBZk) (Google Sheets) that helps us manage the work, and see progress.

- What parts make the product
- Have those parts been designed; are the problems
- What can X do right now, to proceed the product
- Are we there, yet?
