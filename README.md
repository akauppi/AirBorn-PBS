# Kotka PBS

This page tells how to build and deploy the documentation.

## Requirements

(none, for the moment)

>We might use [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) at some point, for the publication, but for now raw markup files are enough.


## Getting started

Open `Index.md` and take it from there.
